# Portfolio
My porfolio website. Created to show potential employers, and others, what I can do when it comes to web design. Also used to 
introduce myself and display my completed projects.

## Technology
- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

## Discoveries
Finally figured out the proper way to use flexboxes after a lot of time struggling with the concept.

## Future Goals
 - Make the color scheme a bit more presentable
 - Use x-axis margins so that the content doesn't take up the whole page
 - Add current projects and links
