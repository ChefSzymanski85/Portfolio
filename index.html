        <h3 id="body-header">I am a software engineering student living in Chapel Hill, NC</h3>
        <p>As a former professional chef, I am looking to utilize the skills I've learned
        in the kitchen to become a web developer. I have adapted a strong worth ethic
        and excellent communication skills. Now I've decided to use my passion as a chef
        to start a career for my other passion, software development!</p>
        <p>Some of my interests include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cooking all sorts of different food from all around the world</li>
          <li>Watching sports and playing fantasy sports</li>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="group">
          <div class="item-margin">
            <p>After graduating high school I took community college courses and worked for Whole 
              Foods Market, where I first had an opportunity to try professional cooking. This led 
              me to get my Culinary Arts degree at Wake Technical Community College. For eight years 
              I worked in kitchens, working my way up from pantry line cook, to banquet sous chef. 
              I had a lot of great experiences in my culinary journey but decided it was time for a 
              change. I am working hard to make changes for a more normal life and I know that 
              Thinkful will allow me to achieve that. I am now learning so much about software development, 
              and plan to be a full-stack developer by the end of the year!
            </p>
            <p>In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games and watching sports. I have been 
              infatuated with the internet since I was a child. I still remember that
              annoying noise the modem used to make while trying to connect to AOL. In high school, I 
              even created a basic website from scratch. Nowadays I enjoy browsing the web to find 
              useful information and marvel at all the beautiful websites out there. I often think 
              about what goes into making such masterful websites. I'm excited to work with others who are
              just as passionate about web design. As soon as I finish my program at Thinkful, I will 
              be able to provide several services. I will be able to create or fix websites, as well as 
              assist in any companies' front-end or back-end needs.
